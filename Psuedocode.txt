pseudo-code for UNO:
public variable countModifier = 1; //This modifier is never used in the code
start of game:
	get number of players;
	give each player 7 random cards;
	put remaining cards in stack;
	setup playerOrder;
	
while(no one has a score that is more than or equal to 500) /* You don't need a do while loop if the condition always starts as false - just a while loop will do
{
	for(CurrentPlayer = 0; CurrentPlayer < playerCount; CurrentPlayer++)
	{
		for(currentCard = 0; amountOfCardsPlayerHas > currentCard; currentCard++)
		{
			if(it is of a matching color or number)

				card's score++;
				if(it's a symbol)
					card's score++;
					if(it's a wildDrawFour)
						card's score++;

				case numberCard;
					break;

					countModifier--;
					break;
				case DrawTwo:
					CurrentPlayer++ (or Player 0 if CurrentPlayer = playerCount-1) needs to take 2 cards from the stack;

					break;
				case Wild:					
					topCard.color = playerInput;
					break;
				case wildDrawFour;
