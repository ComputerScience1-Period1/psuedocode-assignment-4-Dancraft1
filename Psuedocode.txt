pseudo-code for UNO:
public variable countModifier = 1;
start of game:
	get number of players;
	give each player 7 random cards;
	put remaining cards in stack;
	setup playerOrder; // current player's score = 0; needs to be defined according to each player, not as a single var
do
{
	for(whoNeedsToPlay = playerCount; whoNeedsToPlay > 0 && whoNeedsToPlay < playerCount + 1; whoNeedsToPlay -= 1)
	{
		for(currentCard = 0; amountOfCardsPlayerHas > currentCard; currentCard++) 
		{
			if(it is of a matching color or number)
			{
				card's score++;
				if(it's a symbol)
					card's score++;
					if(it's a wildDrawFour)
						card's score++;
			}
		}
		if(they have a card with a score of more than zero)
		{
			topCard = card with highest score;
			switch(cardType)
			{
				case numberCard;
					break;
				case Skip:
					countModifier--;
					break;
				case DrawTwo:
					player who is next in whoNeedsToPlay index needs to take 2 cards from the stack;
					break;
				case Reverse:
					countModifier *= -1;
					break;
				case Wild:					
					topCard.color = playerInput;
					break;
				case wildDrawFour;
					player who is next in whoNeedsToPlay index takes 4 cards;
					topCard.color = playerInput;
					break;
			}
		}
		else {
			player takes card from stack;
	 		/* idk what you're doing so imma just rewrite it for you
			for(int currentPlayer = 0; playerlist.length > currentPlayer; currentPlayer++)
			{
	 			current counted player's score += current checked player's score;

			// idk what you're doing for playerlist but im going to treat it as an object
			for(int x=0; x < playerlist.length; x++){
				playerlist[x].playerScore += howeverMuchYouWantToAdd;

}while(no one has a score that is more than or equal tos 500)
